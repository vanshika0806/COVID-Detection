# COVID-Detection

Currently, nucleic acid test kit is used for RT-PCR to establish the existence of the viral
disease causing nucleic acid, to aid detection of Covid-19. However, the most of these
symptoms are indicators of respiratory infections and diseases and lung abnormalities,
which can be detected by radiologists with CT scan images. Consequently, it is feasible
to make use of ML algorithms to diagnose COVID-19 from the pictures of CT scans
and chest X-rays. We can create automated applications to help radiologists diagnose
the disease significantly quicker and more accurately. This project is an effort at making
use of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to train models to be able to detect the percentage
of COVID-19 in patients. We made use of 1000 different chest X-ray images and some
750 images of CT-scans as dataset to train and test out models. Eighty percentage of
the images were used to train the respective models and the rest of them were utilised
for testing the various deep learning models. We made use of XCEPTION, VGG16,
ResNet50 and InceptionV3 to train the models which eventually resulted in 8 deep
learning models.
